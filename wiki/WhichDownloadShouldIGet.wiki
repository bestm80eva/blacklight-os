= End users: Floppy disk .img =

For those who just want to play around with Blacklight OS without modifying the source code or writing programs of their own designs, stable builds of the OS are available as `.zip`ped floppy disk images. These images include sample programs written by the Blacklight OS Team and other developers who join in the fun!


= Casual development: Source/binary .tar.gz =

We also release tarballs of stable builds with preloaded floppy images (exactly like the ones in the `.zip` files for end users) and the full source code to Blacklight OS and any open-source programs included with it. Releases like these are the best way to get started with developing for Blacklight OS.


= Cutting-edge development: Subversion =

Latest unstable builds are often uploaded to the SVN with new features and bugfixes for testing. Please note that these builds are most definitely not bug-free, and a floppy disk image is located the SVN repository in a gzipped file (`fat12.tar.gz`) to be modified and booted. Please visit the Source tab for more information on checking out the repository.
