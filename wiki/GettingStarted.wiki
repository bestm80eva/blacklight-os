== Selecting a Package ==

The first thing you need to do is find a package that's right for you. There are three ways to obtain Blacklight OS: a *.zipped floppy disk image*, in a *source tarball*, or from the *Subversion repository*. For more information on each of the packages, see [WhichDownloadShouldIGet Which Download Should I Get?].

== Downloading Your Package ==

The floppy images and source tarballs are available on the [https://code.google.com/p/blacklight-os/downloads/list Downloads tab]. For information on how to check out a latest unstable build, see the [https://code.google.com/p/blacklight-os/source/checkout Source tab].

= Building Blacklight OS =

If you have chosen the Subversion repository, you need to run `build.bat` in order to assemble the latest kernel. This process requires the latest version of [http://www.nasm.us/ NASM]. You can then update a floppy image with your new `uvlight.krn` file. Options for editing the floppy image include a fabulous shareware program called WinImage or the freeware ImDisk.

= Running Blacklight OS =

The floppy image can be directly booted by an x86 emulator/virtualization platform such as QEMU or VirtualBox (the latter is that which is primarily used for testing Blacklight OS by the development team), or it can be written to a physical floppy and used to boot a physical computer. Congratulations, you now have a working copy of Blacklight OS!
