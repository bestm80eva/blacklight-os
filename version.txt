- Version 0.0.2 (internal)
  - Memory management still isn't finished. Kernel now searches for UVSH.BIN,
    and if it finds it, loads it to 2000:0000 and executes it as a program. If
    it can't find UVSH.BIN, it prompts the user to enter a filename to load as
    a shell, and proceeds from there. FAT12 system calls have been added.

- Version 0.0.1 (internal)
  - Initial stable code. Ported MikeOS 4.3b7 FAT12 driver. Built system call
    interface using far calls and segment-changing wrappers. As a test, an
    unreleased MikeOS program I wrote called Extended CPUID was ported to
    Blacklight OS with minimal effort, producing exactly the same results as
    the MikeOS version after a wee bit of kernel tweaking.
